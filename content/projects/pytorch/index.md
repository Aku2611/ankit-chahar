This project explores the creation of adversarial examples
against image classification models, analyzes their effective-
ness, and provides information on the fundamental vulner-
abilities of deep neural networks. Our work builds on es-
tablished techniques while introducing modifications to im-
prove attack efficiency and effectiveness.
